  <h1> Hellooo everyone!!! This is day 1 of learning  javascript from scratch</h1>
  <h2>Today Im learning about variables in javascript</h2>
  <p>
    variable is something like a container that holds a value, that value can be vary from string to number or it can be a array or object.
  </p>
  <p>
    let name = Rupjyoti;
    here name is a variable that holds a string value.
  </p>
  <p>We can declaer a variable using</p>
  <ul>
    <li>let</li>
    <li>const</li>
    <li>var</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>let:</strong> let has a block scope,that means we cannot access a variable out side from a block {} and we can not redeclear a variables using let within the same block.i.e suppose let name = "rupjyoti" then again we can not write  let name = "rohit", we can only reassign the value. <br>
    let name = "Rupjyoti";   <br>
    name = "rohit";
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    <strong>const:</strong> Similarlly const also have block scope, the difference of let and const is 
    <ul>
      <li>we can not reassign values in const</li>
      <li>and every time we are using const , we have to assign a value, as like let we can not declear const without assigning value</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
